# Artist Analysis
This is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that I developed in order to help me collect versions of songs and take notes on the songs and artists that I analyze. I wrote most of this program in 2019, however I did make a few changes recently. 

This project also served as an experiment in using seperate HTML files and then programatically inserting them into a `div` elements using JavaScript. I wanted to do this in as close to Vanilla JavaScript as possible, so the only libraries I used are JQuery and a library called long-press to add touch and hold capabilities. 

I used the YouTube API to import playlists and I borrowed and recolored some of the assets from an old, unmaintained program by Hottrix called App.Cat.

You can test out the web application [here](https://kylecourounis.github.io/songanalysis).
